    "## What is Isolation Game?\n",
    "It is played by two players on a 5x5 board. A move can be made to a neighboring (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) position that contains a current square and mark the current square as \"has been\" square. The player who cannot make any move loses the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective in this course is to build a isolation game player, using AI techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts:\n",
    "- O: computer player move \n",
    "- X: an opponent\n",
    "- +1: win by the computer player\n",
    "- -1: win by the opponent\n",
    "- △: turn when the computer player is trying to maximize the score\n",
    "- ▽: turn thwn the opponent player is trying to minimize the score\n",
